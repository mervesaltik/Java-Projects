1- TIC TAC TOE: <br>
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X , your friend is O . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.<br>

2- Hangman: <br>
In this game we enter a letter. And we try to guess the word. For every letter or number that the player does not know, a part of the gallows is drawn.
If you enter more than one letter or something that is not a letter, you get the 'Invalid Input' warning. <br>

4- Rock Paper Scissors: <br>
In this game, you first choose rock (1), paper (2) or scissors (3). Then the computer chooses it randomly. It shows what both sides have chosen. Finally, it announces the winner.

Here are the codes I wrote while trying to read, write and create files in Java.
